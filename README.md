# Project Second hand community API ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘œ

This project was made as a larger project with the aim to incorporate several different techniques including React, Redux, Node.js and MongoDB. This repo contains the backend part of the project, while the frontend part can be found at: https://github.com/elsareutersward/project-final-frontend.

## The problem

The Second hand community site uses an API built using Express and MongoDB to sign up users, saving products and fetching information. During the project I learnt how to model data in Mongoose, how to fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose and how to seed large amounts of data to a database. I also learnt to build a full API which includes handling of user input and includes error handling to return good validation errors. I also practiced creating an API that would work well with an existing frontend.
